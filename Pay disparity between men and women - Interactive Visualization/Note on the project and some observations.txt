DATA: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-03-05

Here, I learned to create an interactive plot to understand the pay disparity between men and 
women in the workplace. Also important, to ask the right questions to understand the data.

OBSERVATIONS:
Health care practitioners/CS Engineers have higher pay and with a steady increase over the years.
Service industry pays the least with a slight increase in pay over the years.

There's a large disparity in pay among men and women in the Healtcare field.
The least disparity in pay is seen in the Computer, Engineering and Science field.

Healthcare Practitioners and Legal minor categories have a larger pay disparity.
Community and social service minor category has the least pay disparity.
